      I was lookin' for a long time I never found nobody like you
      I saw you order up a Mai Tai
      Suddenly, I wanted one too
      I got your name, got your number
      And we talked 'til they turned on the lights
      I was lookin' for a long time
      I didn't know that night I'd find
      My person
      My heartbeat
      My slow dance
      My Sunday-morning-sippin'-on-coffee in bed
      My know-when-you-know best friend
      The stealin' of my t-shirts of my t-shirts
      My reason for speedin' home from work
      My saving grace, my everything
      I've never been more sure that you're my person
      Even when you blow the punchline
      Nobody makes me laugh like you do
      Every minute is a long time
      If I ain't holdin' on to you
      You're my stay-in on the weekend
      You're my come undone
      You're my call home, sayin' it's more than love
      Momma, she's the one
      Yeah, you're my person

      Look ahead up the road
      And you know I'll see you there
      Rockin' chair, little gray in your hair
      Yeah, I'm still gonna stare
